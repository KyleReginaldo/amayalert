# Change Password Feature

This document describes the implementation of the change password functionality in the Amayalert Flutter application.

## Overview

The change password feature allows authenticated users (non-guest users) to update their account password through a secure process that requires verification of their current password.

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified

1. **lib/feature/auth/change_password_screen.dart** (NEW)

   - Main UI screen for changing passwords
   - Includes form validation and user feedback
   - Security tips and best practices display

2. **lib/feature/auth/auth_provider.dart** (MODIFIED)

   - Added `changePassword()` method
   - Implements secure password change process with current password verification

3. **lib/core/router/app_route.dart** (MODIFIED)

   - Added ChangePasswordRoute configuration

4. **lib/feature/settings/settings_screen.dart** (MODIFIED)

   - Added "Change Password" option in Security section
   - Conditional display (hidden for guest users)

5. **test/auth_provider_test.dart** (NEW)
   - Basic unit tests for the auth provider

## Features

### UI Components

- **Current Password Field**: Secure input with visibility toggle
- **New Password Field**: Secure input with validation
- **Confirm Password Field**: Matching validation
- **Security Tips**: Best practices for password creation
- **Info Card**: Requirements and guidelines

### Validation Rules

- Current password is required
- New password must be at least 6 characters
- New password must be different from current password
- Confirm password must match new password

### Security Features

- Re-authentication with current password before update
- Guest user protection (change password hidden for anonymous users)
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and progress indicators

## Usage

### For Users

1. Navigate to Settings from the profile tab
2. Tap "Change Password" in the Security section
3. Enter current password
4. Enter and confirm new password
5. Tap "Change Password" button

### For Developers

#### AuthProvider Usage

```dart
final authProvider = AuthProvider();
final result = await authProvider.changePassword(
  currentPassword: 'current123',
  newPassword: 'newPassword123',
);

if (result.isSuccess) {
  // Password changed successfully
  print(result.value);
} else {
  // Handle error
  print(result.error);
}
```

#### Navigation

```dart
// Navigate to change password screen
context.router.push(const ChangePasswordRoute());
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Current Password Verification**: The system re-authenticates the user with their current password before allowing the change
2. **Guest User Protection**: Anonymous users cannot access the change password feature
3. **Input Validation**: Client-side validation prevents common password mistakes
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages without exposing sensitive information

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- No authenticated user
- Incorrect current password
- Network connectivity issues
- Supabase authentication errors

## Testing

Basic unit tests are provided in `test/auth_provider_test.dart`. For comprehensive testing, consider:

- Integration tests for the full password change flow
- UI tests for form validation
- Error scenario testing
- Guest user restriction testing

## Dependencies

This feature relies on:

- Supabase Flutter for authentication
- Auto Route for navigation
- Flutter EasyLoading for user feedback
- Lucide Icons for UI icons

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Password strength indicator
2. Password history validation
3. Two-factor authentication integration
4. Audit logging for password changes
5. Password expiration policies
